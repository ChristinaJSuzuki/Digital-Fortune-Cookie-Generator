# Digital Fortune Cookie Generator

## Description:
  The user cracks open a fortune cookie, inside the cookie there is a paper that contains a random message.

## Tools :
  The language of my choice for this project was only JavaScript, for the fortune cookie I used ASCII art to depict the whole cookie and the cookie when cracked, and lastly to host the code I used git and github.

## How to Run the Program:

  1. Open the terminal in VS Code by going to **Terminal -> New Terminal or pressing `Ctrl + ``**.
   
  2. In the terminal, make sure you are in the correct directory where the script.js file is saved. If not, navigate to it using the cd command, for example:

    cd path/to/your/project/folder

  3. Run the JavaScript file using **Node.js** with the following command:

    node script.js

    You should see the fortune cookie cracking process and the random fortune displayed in the terminal.
    
  4. Re-run the Code.

    Each time you want to run the code again and get a new fortune, just type the **node script.js** command again in the terminal.
